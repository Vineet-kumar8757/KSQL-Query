CREATE STREAM MOVEMENTS 
(PERSON VARCHAR KEY, LOCATION VARCHAR) WITH 
 (VALUE_FORMAT= 'JSON', PARTITIONS=1, KAFKA_TOPIC='movements');

INSERT INTO movements
VALUES('Allison', 'Denver');
INSERT INTO movements
VALUES('Robin', 'Leeds');
INSERT INTO movements
VALUES('Robin', 'Ilkley');
INSERT INTO movements
VALUES('Allison', 'Boulder');

To see all the streams : SHOW STREAMS;
To see from the beginning of the stream: SET 'auto.offset.reset'='earliest';

To continuously see the streams : SELECT * FROM movements emit changes;

Reading and writing data from/to Kafka
CREATE STREAM people WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='topic1',
VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO');


CREATE TABLE PERSON_STATS WITH (VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO') AS 
SELECT PERSON, LATEST_BY_OFFSET (LOCATION) AS LATEST_LOCATION, 
COUNT(*) AS LOCATION_CHANGES, COUNT_DISTINCT (LOCATION) AS
UNIQUE_LOCATIONS FROM MOVEMENTS GROUP BY PERSON EMIT CHANGES;
